# test-for-fast-style-transfer
try others' fast-style-transfer project
Platfrom is Windows10. 
Some dependcies' version is very important. For example python3.8 has not a statisfied tensorflow package.
Some grammar of fast-style-transfer is not useful for newest package. So i need to reinstall the older package.
Also i learned something about windows' shell script.
The project i test, its url is https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer
